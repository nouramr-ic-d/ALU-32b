# ALU-32b
The objective of this design problem is to create an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of  performing various arithmetic and logical operations on two 16-bit inputs, based on a third input  known as the "opcode." The ALU should produce a 32-bit output representing the result of the  selected operation.
#Submit the following items as part of your assignment:
• The RTL code for the 16-bit ALU in Verilog.
• The Verilog testbench code for the ALU, including multiple test cases.
• Screenshots or logs of the simulation results showing the ALU's correct operation for all 
test cases.
